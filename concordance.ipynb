    "`nltk` has a built-in function called `FreqDist` which counts up how many times each word in a text occurs. So, if you have a list called `words` which contains all the words in a book, you can find the frequencies of all of them by writing `freq = nltk.FreqDist(words)`. You can then get the e.g. ten most common words by writing `freq.most_common(10)`. What are the ten most common words in Jane Austen's \"Emma\"? What about Herman Melville's \"Moby Dick\"?"

    "Often, the most frequent words are not the most interesting ones. Words like \"a\" and \"the\" are so common in English, that they don't really tell us much about the text. That is why we often remove \"stopwords\", that is, a list of the most common words in English, before e.g. counting frequencies. There are several of these lists available, in [English]((https://gist.github.com/sebleier/554280)) as well as other languages, such as [Danish](https://gist.github.com/berteltorp/0cf8a0c7afea7f25ed754f24cfc2467b). Below is some starter code to remove stopwords. Use these snippets to see what the most common words in Emma and Moby Dick are after removing these most common words.\n",
